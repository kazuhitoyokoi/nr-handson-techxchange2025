# Node-RED Hands-on: Creating a Node-RED application using the project feature

- [How to execute Node-RED on GitHub Codespaces](codespaces.md)



## Abstruct
Node-RED is a low-code development tool released by IBM as an open source software. This tool is easy to use for novice users and it is also a powerful tool for IT professionals. Node-RED supports debugging, linting, and Git version control for the professional use. In this hands-on session, I will introduce these features and show how to use them effectively. As an application example, we will develop a chat application with an interactive user interface and a Granite model in the background model. Participants will learn how to set up the Node-RED environment and create flows from scratch. Through this hands-on experience, participants will learn the development techniques using Node-RED, including best practices for managing flows and using version control to track changes.

## What is Node-RED?
Node-RED is a low-code development tool released by IBM as an open source software. This tool is easy to use for novice users and it is also a powerful tool for IT professionals. 
It has become a common tool in the manufacturing industry to create intelligent IoT solutions using flow-based development with low-code.
